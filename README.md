# Kickstarting with Excel
- Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
- box and whisker plot shows the difference of goals vs. pledge in Musicals in Great Briton, 25% of those Kickstarter campaigns did not receive funding.
- category statistics show us the outcomes of the campaigns in the parent Catagory groups in all countries
- the Subcategory Statistics are shoeing the outcomes for plays in all countries
- outcomes based on launch date show us the success rate of theater kickstarters based on quarter release all years compiled
- Edinburgh research shows us specific information on these five plays requested by the employer
- descriptive statistics-plays shows statistics of successful and failed goals and pledges of plays
- descriptive stats-Wearable Tech shows statistics of successful and failed goals and pledges of Wearable technology
- descriptive stats-Photo PB shows statistics of successful and failed goals and pledges of photobooks

## Overview of Project 

### Purpose
-   The purpose of this project is to get a better of Kickstarters, To see if there are any corliation between sucess and failure and other factors, such as country, technology, time, and amount.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
-   As shown in the graph labeled Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch, though most of the for theaters it is best to launch kickstarters in May and the worst time would be in December. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
-   as shown in the graph labeled Outcomes based on goals the best goals toe set are any less than $15,000 and anthing between $35,000-$40,000. any other and the likly hoo that the Kickstarter will fail are higher.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
-   I had a few issues with using the COUNTIFS functions but after watching the hint it made sense.
-   My excel spread sheet started slowing down a bit due to previous work I did. after deleting a few of the extra sheets i started working better, Excel only has so much storage and processing power unlike a date base.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
-   the most successful launching date is in May, the kickstarters were least successful is in December

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
-   Goals are most successful when they are smaller, and also between $35,000-50,000. Most of the kickstarters with the goals greater than $50,000, either get canceled or fail.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
-   For the Ourcomes based on goals it looks at all of the kickstarters and not by specific catgory


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
-   we could created tables and graphs for specific catagories to give more accurate data for whome needs it
